  description: "Rests upon grounds that once held the earthly remains of San Francisco's earliest residents.  Over the years, a variety of manifestations, including eerie flickering lights and power tools mysteriously turning on and off, were reported by students.  In response to the incidents that year, a s√©ance was held in the tower with several prominent psychics. One saw a lost graveyard, and a historian later verified that an adjacent cemetery had indeed been demolished before the school was built.  It is very clear that the ghosts of the San Francisco Art Institute don't want people in their tower.",
